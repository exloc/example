# Exloc Code Example

This git repository serves as an example for what [exloc.io](https://exloc.io)
code examples (**exlocs**) should look like.


## Files

At a minimum, you should include the following files for your code example to
be imported by [exloc.io](https://exloc.io):

* exloc.json - metadata about the code example
* exloc.md - details about the code example, written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* source code files - any supporting files necessary for your code example to work


## Creating your own exlocs

If you have an existing repository that you would like to add to [exloc.io](https://exloc.io),
modify the `exloc.json` and `exloc.md` files to suit the code example, and add
them to your repository.


## Adding an exloc

Copy the git URL for your repository, then visit [exloc.io](https://exloc.io) for
instructions on how to add a new exloc repository.
